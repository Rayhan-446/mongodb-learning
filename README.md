# MongoDB Learning Journey

This repository contains my MongoDB learning scripts, exercises, and notes.

## Structure
- `01-basics/` → first DB & collection
- `02-crud/` → CRUD operations
- `03-aggregation/` → aggregation framework
- `notes.md` → learning notes

## How I Practice
1. Open `mongosh` to run commands.
2. Save commands in `.js` files.
3. Push progress to GitHub.
